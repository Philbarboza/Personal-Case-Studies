In this self solved project, which makes part of dataquest.io Data Analyst R Track, I will analyze a database called Chinook.db. 
The Chinook database contains information about various elements in a fictional digital music shop, such as artists, songs, albums, 
as well as the shop’s employees, customers, and the customers’ purchases. 

The purpose of this project, is to get more familiar the use of intermediare SQL functions like subqueries, advanced joins like UNION, INTERSECT or 
the use of WITH statements, to finally answer business questions.
